# Hermetic test for scripts/release/branch-hygiene.sh.
#
# Builds a throwaway git repo with a known branch topology and asserts that the
# hygiene script:
#   * marks branches whose tip is contained in main/the release branch as
#     "safe to delete",
#   * keeps a branch with unique commits from a non-Hunter contributor as
#     contributor work (never a safe delete),
#   * flags a branch with only unmerged maintainer commits as needs-review,
#   * detects a working checkout parked on an already-merged scratch branch,
#   * actually deletes only safe branches under --prune --yes and never the
#     contributor branch.
